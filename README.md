# Crowdfunding_ETL
NW Bootcamp Project 2

As stated by my partner Adam in his repo https://github.com/AdamKarner/Crowdfunding_ETL, this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script is designed to process and transform data from a crowdfunding dataset (crowdfunding.xlsx) and a contacts dataset (contacts.xlsx) using Python and Pandas. The script performs data extraction, transformation, and exports the final transformed data into CSV files that can be further used to create an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and a PostgreSQL database. In order to complete this project I used this repo for reference to review my code. https://github.com/Asalvs/Crowdfunding_ETL
