# Crowdfunding_ETL
NW Bootcamp Project 2

This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script is designed to process and transform data from a crowdfunding dataset (crowdfunding.xlsx) and a contacts dataset (contacts.xlsx) using Python and Pandas. The script performs data extraction, transformation, and exports the final transformed data into CSV files that can be further used to create an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and a PostgreSQL database.
